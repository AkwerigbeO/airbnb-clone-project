‚ú® Feature Breakdown

The project includes several key features designed to replicate core functionalities of a modern property rental platform, ensuring smooth user interaction, scalability, and data reliability.

1. User Management

Handles authentication, registration, and role management for both guests and hosts.
Users can create accounts, log in securely using JWT authentication, and manage their profiles. Hosts can list properties, while guests can browse and make bookings.

2. Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings.
Each listing includes essential details such as location, pricing, amenities, and availability. This feature ensures that users can easily discover and compare properties based on their preferences.

3. Booking System

Facilitates end-to-end booking functionality for guests.
Users can select available dates, make reservations, and view booking history. The system validates date overlaps, ensuring no double-bookings occur and that both hosts and guests have visibility into booking statuses.

4. Payment Integration

Implements secure online payment processing using Stripe or Paystack.
This feature handles payment confirmations, refunds, and transaction tracking. It ensures that hosts receive payments promptly while guests enjoy a seamless checkout experience.

5. Review and Rating System

Enables guests to submit reviews and ratings for properties after their stay.
Reviews improve trust within the platform and help other users make informed booking decisions. Hosts can also view feedback to enhance their service offerings.

6. Admin Dashboard

Provides administrators with tools for system monitoring, user oversight, and data management.
Admins can review user activity, manage listings, moderate reviews, and ensure platform policies are maintained efficiently.

üîí API Security

Security is a core aspect of the Airbnb Clone backend to ensure the protection of sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain trust between users and the platform. The following security measures are implemented across the system to safeguard users, hosts, and payment transactions.

1. Authentication

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to verify user identity during API requests.
Each user must log in to receive a token that grants access to protected endpoints. This ensures that only authenticated users can perform actions such as booking properties, managing listings, or posting reviews.

üîπ Importance: Protects against unauthorized access and impersonation attacks.

2. Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) determines what actions a user can perform based on their role ‚Äî for example, hosts can create properties, while guests can make bookings.
Sensitive endpoints (like admin dashboards) are restricted to authorized personnel only.

üîπ Importance: Prevents privilege escalation and ensures users only access data relevant to their role.

3. Data Encryption

Sensitive information such as passwords and payment data is encrypted using industry-standard hashing (bcrypt) and SSL/TLS protocols.
All communication between the frontend and backend occurs over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and data tampering.

üîπ Importance: Protects personal data and financial transactions from interception or theft.

4. Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, rate limiting is applied to API endpoints.
This restricts the number of requests a single user or IP can make within a set timeframe.

üîπ Importance: Ensures server stability and prevents malicious actors from overwhelming the system.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization

All input data is validated and sanitized at the API level using Django REST Framework serializers and middleware.
This mitigates risks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and data corruption.

üîπ Importance: Maintains data integrity and protects the backend from injection-based attacks.

6. Secure Payment Handling

Payment processes are handled through trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe or Paystack), ensuring compliance with PCI-DSS security standards.
The backend never stores raw credit card details; only transaction references and status information are saved.

üîπ Importance: Ensures financial data is processed securely, protecting users and the platform from fraud.


‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for automating the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. They ensure that every code change is automatically validated and deployed in a reliable, consistent, and efficient manner.

What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically builds and tests new code each time changes are pushed to the repository. This helps detect errors early and maintain a stable codebase.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatically deploys tested and verified code to production or staging environments, ensuring faster delivery and reducing manual intervention.

Importance for the Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline enhances collaboration, reliability, and productivity among developers. It ensures that:

Code changes are tested before merging, preventing regressions.

Deployments are repeatable, predictable, and less prone to human error.

New features and bug fixes reach users more quickly.

Tools & Technologies

The project‚Äôs CI/CD process can be built using the following tools:

GitHub Actions: Automates workflows such as testing, linting, building Docker images, and deploying code.

Docker: Ensures that the application runs consistently across all environments (development, staging, and production).

Docker Compose: Used to define and manage multi-container services during automated testing.

AWS / Render / DigitalOcean (Optional): For hosting and deployment of the backend application.

pytest: Executes automated tests during the CI phase to ensure code reliability before deployment.
