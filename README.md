Airbnb Clone Backend
üöÄ Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Backend is a robust and scalable server-side application designed to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. It powers key operations such as user authentication, property management, booking and payment processing, and review management.

Built with performance, modularity, and security in mind, this backend provides RESTful and GraphQL APIs for seamless frontend integration while ensuring efficient data handling and optimized system performance.

The system is fully containerized for smooth deployment and includes background task management, caching, and CI/CD pipelines to support real-world scalability.
